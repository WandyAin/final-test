## Context
A set of architecture principles for user-centred, iteratively delivered and continuously improved digital services at the Department for Education.

These principles might not always be equally important for every service. It is the role of the architect to apply the principles that make sense for their situation and to draw insight from the others where appropriate.

## Start small and focus on user needs
Focus on understanding the user needs your service needs to meet and how it will do that. See if you have different sets of users with different needs. Consider whether you can do this using existing tools to keep your technology simple. Document your choices and why they were made so everyone can learn from your journey.

Donâ€™t start with the solution.
